    <h2>West African Cuisine</h2>
    <div id="food1">
        <p>
            The food in West Africa is none other than absolutely delicious. There are plenty of fresh grains to go around in our beautiful society: millet, rice, and sorghum (used to make bread). Our farms aren't just worked on privately; everybody contributes to the communal farms, with tasks divided by gender for maximum efficiency!
