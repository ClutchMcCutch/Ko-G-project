        <h2>Families and Villages</h2>
        <p>There are two types of households in West Africa: nuclear and polygynous. Nuclear households have a husband and a single wife, whereas polygynous households have multiple wives. Often, wives live separate from their husbands in their own houses, giving everyone their fair share of privacy that everyone needs at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>Plots of land were worked on communally. Tasks were divided up by gender, having males doing the clearing and females doing the planting. Droughts were common on the savannah, and diseases plagued the animals in the forest. Despite these tough conditions, so much food came to fruition, such as yams, peas, okras, rice, and other grains that happened to make West African cuisine extremely enticing!</p>
        <p>Typical possessions of those who lived in West Africa included cots, rugs, and stools. You could also find people with bows, spears, scythes, and iron axes for hunting and farming.</p>

        <h2>Women</h2>
        <p>Women had ample freedom in West Africa. In Ancient Ghana, women could serve as government officials. Even enslaved women could hold high government positions in Dahomey. This surprised and impressed many travelers! Ibn Battuta, a Muslim Berber, was shocked to observe all of this in the Islamic country of Mali. Women did not veil themseles before men, although they commit themselves fully to their religion.</p>
